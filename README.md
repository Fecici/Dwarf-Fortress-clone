I love fantasy, I love colony management, I love simulation games, and I love a lot more things about Dwarf Fortress. I want to make a game where, instead of an npc dying because its health reached 0, it dies because  (this may be gruesome) the greatsword destroyed a vital artery causing important organs to fail and the body to die. Instead of the quality of a forged axe increasing because of the smith's own level of smithing, the quality inceases because the forger didn't forget to perform whatever vital function was needed, or something like that, I'm sure you get the point. This project is going to be my own litle story-generator I hope, that I can eventually pour my passion for fantasy and creativity into. Currently, I am working on its engine (meaning how entities will interacrt with each other and how the map will be created), as well as a tile editor. I also unironically may have to succomb to using ASCII graphics unless I can get my hands on a proper tileset of graphics.
